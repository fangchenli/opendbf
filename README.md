## What is opendbf?
**opendbf** is a pure Python library that convert DBF file to csv.

## Limitation
**opendbf** was originaly developed to parse parcel records data from the St. Louis, MO government website. Currently it's only tested on that one specific dataset. So it definatly won't support all DBF versions. You are welcome to try it on other DBF files. And if you found any problem and could share your dataset with me, I'll try to make **opendbf** more functionaly complete and support more DBF versions.
